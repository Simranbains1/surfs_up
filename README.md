# Surf's Up!

## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to collect temperature data for Oahu during the month of June and December. This information would be used to determine the feasability of a year-round surf and ice cream shop.

### Method of Analysis
The data was collected using Python, Pandas functions, and SQLAlchemy to filter the correct data into a DataFrame for each month. 

## Results
The data from June and December were very similar, providing the information needed to decide that a year-round shop would not be negatively affected by changes in temperature.
- June and December vary in their mean temperature by less than four degrees, and the weather remains appropriate for ice cream year-round.
- The majority of the data maintained a close range to the average temperature, which means that visitors won't contend with vastly different temperatures in the day-to-day variability. 
- The minimum temperature for each month is the largest variation between the two. December reported a minimum temperature of 56 and June reported a minimum of 64. However, this data is pulled from several years of data, and there is bound to be outliers in the weather patterns over the years.

## Summary
In conclusion, a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu is a great investment. The  weather is pleasant year-round and the shop will attract visitors that appreciate a cold treat after a hard day's surfing.

### Additional Queries
It would be beneficial to collect data on the humidity for June and December. Humidity levels can change our response to certain temperatures (If the temperature is low and humidity high, it will feel warmer than a low temperature and low humidity day)
Additionally, a description of the weather will provide insight into surfing conditions for each month. This would help determine the best months for surfing and predict the busy season for the shop. 
Lastly, wind speed data can provide insight into safe surfing days that would be beneficial for visitors.
